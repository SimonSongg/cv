        <h2>
            Objectives &amp; Main Features
        </h2>
        <p>
            The objectives of the project were to explore the performance
            difference of various stereo matching methods including Sum of Absolute
            Differences, Sum of Squared Differences, Normalized Cross Correlation
            and Semi-global matching (SGM), as well as the choosing of parameters
            such as kernel size. Intel Realsense D455 RGB-D camera was used to
            collect the stereo image pairs. The Intel Realsense RGB-D camera could
            emit infrared ray to assist the depth estimation by adding extra
            features to some surface without feature such as white walls.
            Therefore, whether the infrared ray could help generate better depth
            map will be tested and discussed.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Steps &amp; Implementation
        </h2>
        <p>
            In general, the matching procedure could be executed as shown in the
            flowchart in Figure 2. The idea was to find the same point in the real
            world in both left and right image. Usually, as shown in Figure 1, a
            kernel (a square area) was firstly chosen in one image, for example,
            the left image. Then, starting from the same position as the kernel in
            the left image, a horizontally sliding kernel was created in the right
            image and the cost between the kernel in the left image and the sliding
            kernel in the right image was calculated. The cost function could be
            modified. The kernel position with the least cost in the sliding range,
            which could also be modified, in the right image was considered as a
            match to the left kernel. The pixel distance between the position of
            the left kernel and the one in the right image was the disparity. As
            the closer the object is, the larger the disparity is. The sliding
            range decided the closest distance that the depth map could be
            generated.

        <p>
            Three different cost functions, which were SAD, SSD and NCC, were
            implemented and the performance for each cost function will be
            discussed in the next section.
        </p>

            <strong>Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD)</strong>
        </p>
        $$\sum_{\left(i,j\right)\in W}\left|I_1\left(i,j\right)-I_2\left(x+i,y+j\right)\right|$$

        <p>
            <strong>Sum of Squared Differences (SSD)</strong>
        </p>
        $$\sum_{\left(i,j\right)\in W}\left(I_1\left(i,j\right)-I_2\left(x+i,y+j\right)\right)^2$$

        <p>
            <strong>Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC)</strong>
        </p>
        $$\frac{\sum_{\left(i,j\right)\in W}{I_1\left(i,j\right)\bullet
        I_2\left(x+i,y+j\right)}}{\sqrt[2]{\sum_{\left(i,j\right)\in
        W}{{I^2}_1\left(i,j\right)}\bullet\sum_{\left(i,j\right)\in W}{{I^2}_2\left(x+i,y+j\right)}}}$$
        <h4>
            Semi-global Matching (SGM) - Census Transform &amp; Hamming distance
        </h4>
        <p>
            The previous methods used the sum of the cost for each pixel in the
            kernel between the left and right image to find the best match. In
            another words, the sum of the pixel value difference was used as the
            feature that the matching process referred to.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the scene with little illumination change and with relatively high
            number of features, SAD, SSD and NCC may find pretty good matches.
            However, if the illumination condition was different in two images, the
            matching will be greatly influenced because the mean pixel value will
            be different even if for the same part of the image.
        </p>
        <p>
            Census transform used the pixel difference between the certain pixel
            with the adjacent pixels as the feature for matching. Therefore, it
            could be considered the pattern of changing for each pixel was used. As
            shown in Figure 3, the census transform was to compare the value of the
            center pixel and the pixels around it. If the adjacent pixel was
            larger, encode ‘1’ while the center pixel was larger, encode ‘0’. Then,
            the binary code series of the kernel in left and right images did ‘XOR’
            operation, the output was called Hamming distance, which could be
            considered as cost. The best match should have the smallest Hamming
            distance.

            Results
        </h3>
        <p>
            Three aforementioned cost functions were tested with different size of
            kernels. Moreover, as Intel Realsense RGB-D camera, which could
            actively emit infrared ray with a fixed pattern to assist on-chip
            stereo matching on the camera, was used to collect stereo images, the
            stereo matching performance with or without the assistance of infrared
            ray was tested and compared as well. The collected images were
            self-rectified before output from the camera. Therefore, the images
            were used directly for stereo matching. The resolutions of the images
            for matching were 848*480. Figure 4 and Figure 5 were the image
            captured without infrared ray while Figure 6 and Figure 7 were the
            image captured with infrared ray on. The largest disparity was set to
            100 for completed depth calculation.

        As the figures in Table 1 and 2 shown, for both laser-assisted and normal
        images, the depth map generated by kernels with smaller sizes were noisier
        and with a greater number of pixels that failed to be matched. However, it
        could be observed that although the depth maps generated with large kernels
        were smoother, they lost some of the details of the objects in the image
        such as the sharpness of their shapes. The reason for this phenomenon might
        be that small kernels will have large changes in values when sliding,
        therefore, it was relatively easy to match to a random area that was
        similar to the correct target. On the contrary, large kernels were
        relatively consistent in values, so that large kernels may not reflect
        small details but will be more likely to be smooth. Among three different
        cost functions, it was apparent that the normalized cross correlation (NCC)
        gave matching results with less noise and more valid matching pixels than
        the other two methods did. By using NCC, the improvement was mainly in the
        area that was with little strong features. In the images generated by the
        non-laser image pairs, the depth maps generated by NCC cost function were
        more obviously better than the other two cost functions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Compared the results obtained by the images with infrared lasers with the
        ones without the assistance of the infrared lasers, it was obvious that the
        laser-assisted results were much more detailed, for example, sharp edges on
        objects, and with less failed pixels especially in the area that was lack
        of features. In the three tested methods, only NCC could give reasonable
        matching results without the assistance of infrared ray.

        As for the time cost to calculate the matching, SAD cost function took the
        shortest time to calculate the matching and NCC was the most time-consuming
        one. Moreover, the larger the kernel was, the slower the calculation was.
        This trend was applied to all three methods because larger kernels simply
        led to more computation for each round of cost calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
        These three methods all cost more than one minute to generate only one
        depth map, which was too slow for some application like robotic vision that
        needed very high real-time performance. One possible solution was to used
        FPGA to calculate the depth because the calculation in stereo matching can
        be executed in parallel. It was speculated that Intel Realsnese RGB-D
        camera used FPGA inside the camera to do the stereo matching.
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
        For Semi-global Matching, I still cannot fully understand the process of
        cost aggregation, which could give a smoother and more precise depth
        estimation. Therefore, I only coded the calculation of census
        transformation and Hamming distance by myself, and I will use an
        open-sourced code to generate the final result for comparison.

        It could be observed that the depth was changing smoothly on surfaces and
        was sharp on the edges. The scene was naturally presented, and objects
        could be clearly recognized in the depth map.

        In conclusion, the window-based stereo matching performance with three
        different cost functions, which were SAD, SSD and NCC, was discussed. It
        was found that NCC had the best matching performance while it took the
        longest time to compute. Moreover, the projection of infrared ray was
        proved to be effective to generate depth maps with higher quality because
        it could add extra features to the field of view so that the matching
        algorithms could find the correct match with less effort, especially for
        the area with little strong features. Additionally, the matching algorithm
        needed to be implemented on specially designed FPGA for real-time
        operation.
